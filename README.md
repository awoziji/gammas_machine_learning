Mostly scikit-learn tools used in Gamma-ray ground based astronomy gamma-hadron classification.

Gamma ray astronomy is the astronomical observation of gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, with photon energies above 100 keV. Radiation below 100 keV is classified as X-rays and is the subject of X-ray astronomy.

When gamma rays reach the earth’s atmosphere they interact with it, producing cascades of subatomic particles. These cascades are also known as air or particle showers. Nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, but light travels 0.03 percent slower in air. Thus, these ultra-high energy particles can travel faster than light in air, creating a blue flash of “Cherenkov light”.

Cherenkov light is not only produced by gammas, but by hadrons also; this kind of light is called *background*.
A good background suppression (identify all events detected by the camera generated by hadrons and suppress them) is crucial for progress in this field: here's where **machine learning** comes in.
